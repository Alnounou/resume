I have three passions in my life: learning, teaching, and excellence. 

I feel that my purpose in life so far has been to raise young adults. I find that everything I experienced so far has been preparing me for the time I would be building the minds and attitudes of the following generations.

Being a teacher/student/tutor most my life I believe I am at my peak capacity for learning and contributing to educating others. I love teaching and am quite patient.
